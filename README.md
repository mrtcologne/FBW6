To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].

- [x] Finish my changes
- [ ] Push my commits to GitHub
- [ ] Open a pull request

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
